  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome!</h1>
I started this website as a way to motivate myself to engage with the material that I see in my life, both in my studies and elsewhere. There are so many fascinating topics to explore that I have ignored or put on the back burner, and I hope that this will be my opportunity to give them the attention they deserve. As a Computer Science major, a lot of these topics will be related to technology, but I'm certain they won't all be. Please take a look around, and contact me if you would like.

<p>If you're curious, I've also included a look at some of the <a href='/projects/'>projects</a> I've been able to work on.</p>
