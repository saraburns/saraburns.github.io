  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome!</h1>
I started this website as a way to motivate myself to engage with the material that I see in my life, both in my studies and in my individual investigations . As a Computer Science major, this material primarily relates to computing and technology, but it doesn't always. I often find that I learn passively, without taking the time to delve deeper, and I think this is detrimental both to my understanding and my power of expression. I don't always think independently, and I would like to remedy that. For the first few months, the blog may be sparse, and it may not be laser-focused, but please bear with me!

<p>If you're curious, I've also included a look at some of the <a href='/projects/'>projects</a> I've been able to work on. Enjoy!</p>
