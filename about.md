My name is Sara Burns. I am a student majoring in Computer Science at Wellesley College with interests in full-stack development, natural language processing, 
and open-source. When I'm not coding, I also enjoy playing music, getting outside(in order to counteract my computer screen tan), and hanging out with my unbelievably spoiled cat, Xena. If you'd like to know more or contact me, I have provided my email in the footer and my resume in the header. You can also check out some cool projects I have been able to work on!
